                <strong><small>"He doesnt know what He doesnt know" -My mother</small></strong>
                <p>Where do I begin with my about me section you might ask? well I for one would tell you that I was born May 14, 1999. to my parents Adelmo and Rebecca Marchiori. I am 23 years old. I have had a fascination with knives since i was 6Yrs old. My first knife I ever got was a swiss army pocket knife. From the list of books i have in my list of books i have read my all time favorite is "the Illiad by Homer". i have read that book 4 times over. I am also fascinated by anceint myhtology of the world. my favorite myth/legend is of the "jason and the argonauts". it is where a young man goes in search of the golden fleece but is not told of the 7-headed hydra protecting it, another great classic is perseus in "clash of the titans" made in 1981. Favorite color is Green.</p>
